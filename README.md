## Homework Details

**Name:** Kingshuk Kundu

**Hours Worked:** 20 working hours

**Issues Faced:** The AI occasionally broke working code, and since I hadn't backed it up on GitHub, I had to start from scratch. This experience taught me the importance of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable chunks and verifying each functionality before moving forwardâ€”a much more effective approach.
